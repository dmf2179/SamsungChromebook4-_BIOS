# SamsungChromebook4-_BIOS
Samsung Chromebook 4+ converted to different OSâ€™s 
This is my first project.
Access the back panel of laptop, remove battery and suppliment power with power cord while overwriting verification. After battery can be placed back as you flash BIOS. Decide which os / distros to run. The 4/4+ is N4000 | 4gb ram | emmc 32gb/64gb so not a lot of options.
If booting windows the native audio drivers do not work and need driver + license from Coolstar to work. Coolstar does not support W11 with this devicd currently. W10 is supported but there are some errors still in device manager, other than that it can light browse, light game some indie games but not reccommended. 
Since everything is soidiered as with most chromebooks your best bet is to resale or run a linux distro as w10 is slow. Rec dis
